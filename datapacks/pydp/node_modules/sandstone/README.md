Sandstone is a Typescript library for Minecraft Datapacks. It allows easy creation, debug and sharing of Minecraft functions, loot tables, predicates etc...

## Features

## üíª Perfect autocompletion & IDE support

Sandstone tells you what a command expects, and autocompletes complicated arguments for you.

You don't need to remember commands syntax anymore.

This autocompletion works for all resources: commands, predicates, loot tables, advancements...

## üìÇ Better organisation of resources
You can have multiple functions, advancements, loot tables per files - or you can keep the vanilla organisation, and have only 1 per file. Sandstone allows you to organise your data pack as you prefer, without sticking to Mojang's conventions.

You also benefit from all the capabilities of a real programming language: multiline comments, indentation, documentation...

## üöÄ Useful and heavily optimized abstractions

Sandstone includes common and heavily optimized abstractions:
- Control statements, with `if`, `else if` and `else`
- Boolean logic, with `or`, `and` and `not`
- Loops, with `while` and `for`
- Sleep statement, which waits a certain time before running the next commands

These statements are most of the time more optimized than hand-written code, since they switch between different implementations to get the fastest one. They have been studied and designed for performance.

However, you stay free: you can keep using only vanilla commands, if you prefer - Sandstone does not get in your way.

## üëê Easy to share
Sharing commands has **never been easier**. Just publish your functions on NPM, and everyone can use them to improve their own datapacks. Whether it's some common code like raycasting, or some new abstractions like better `/tellraw`, the Sandstone ecosystem grows by the day.

You can finally stop reinventing the wheel.
